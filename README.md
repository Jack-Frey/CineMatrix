# CineMatrix
Group Project for CSE201 

# How to use
1. Download NodeJS
<br>
Go the the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and download the executable for 
your operating system. <br>
Note: it will ask if you want to install something called chocolatey. This isn't required for this project so don't install it (unless you want to I guess).
<br>

2. Download Github Repo
<br>
Either download the .zip or type 
```
git clone https://github.com/Jack-Frey/CineMatrix 
```
into your terminal, whatever is easier.
<br>

3. Install dependencies
<br>
Navigate to the project folder and type
```
npm install express body-parser node-fetch
```
to download the packages needed to run the project
<br>

4. Run it
<br>
To start the server, type
```
node index.js
```
If everything works, you'll see the text
```
App listening on port 3000
```
Finally, open a web browser and type `localhost:3000` into the address bar.
